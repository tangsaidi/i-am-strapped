# 👍 I Am Strapped 🔫


## Usage

Install strapped.sh:
```bash
curl https://stay.strapped.sh | sh
```

Then run strapped.sh with this repo's yaml (currently the config is specific to macs):
```bash
strapped -y https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fvumbaca/i-am-strapped/master/mac.yml
```

> If linking config files fails, you will need to delete the existing files. Most configs should not conflict if
> strapping on a fresh computer. (If you do need to delete your old configs, please back them up first).
